# exercise-three-js

This is a repository that store codes when I learn [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

There are some standalone `.html` files, and then we can see or debug them separately.

Now I haven't configure `build` CLI, so we can only preview these pages in `development` mode.
```bash
yarn start
```
After do that, you can preview the page1 by visit [http://localhost:5173/src/pages/page1/index.html](http://localhost:5173/src/pages/page1/index.html)
